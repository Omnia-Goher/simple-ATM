# simple-ATM

***Description***

It is required to implement a simple ATM that supports the following:
 Withdrawal, Deposit and Balance Inquiry.
 History navigation through the last 5 transactions.
 First you need to validate card number against a pre-defined number in your system.
 The main menu contains:

1. Five buttons: Withdrawal, Deposit, Balance Inquiry, Previous and Next (the
last two for history navigation)
2. One label: to show either your current balance when hitting Balance Inquiry
button or history navigation when hitting Previous or Next buttons.

 When hitting Withdraw or Deposit buttons, user should be navigated to another
window to enter the amount. You can use buttons representing numbers from 0 to 9 to
take the input and label to show it.
 History should be updated after every successful transaction.
 Handle different special cases and show error dialogs when necessary (e.g. withdrawal
amount is greater than the current balance, etc...).
 [You should create at least 2 classes] The best design is to create a class/classes and
make sure all the logic is working, then create a new class/classes for the GUI.
 It is better to create an interface in the middle between logic class and GUI class/classes.
 [Hint] You can make a separate class called Transaction to hold the transaction type and
value.


This was my first project working with java it's a little messy but wanted to download it anyway :D
